# FML 1.4.7-FE
   
** WIP README **
  
This is a small edit of FML that makes modding mods easier. It disables signature verification on class files and allows mod archives to include patch sets. These patch sets are used to patch class files as they are loaded. This allows advanced modification of other mods without the need to redistribute edited versions of the original mod jars.
