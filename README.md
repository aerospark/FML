# FML
   
    ** WIP README **
  
    This is a small edit of FML, which makes modding 1.4.7 mods much easier. It disables signature verification on class files and allows mod archives to include patch sets. These patch sets can be used to patch class files inside other mod archives as they are loaded. This allows advanced modification of these long lost mods without the need to redistribute modified versions of the original mods.
